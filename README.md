## Overview of the puzzles

### 8 Queens
The 8 Queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os, which is played against an AI. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

### Find Shortest Path
The task is to find the shortest path from 10 cities. The cities are connected by roads. The distance between each city is given. The puzzle provides a start city and an end city. The task is to find the shortest path from the start city to the end city.

### Remember Value Index
The task is to remember the index of a value in an array. The puzzle provides an array of integers and a value. The task is to remember the index of the value in the array.

### Predict Value Index
The task is to predict the index of a value in an array. The puzzle provides a value within an array. The task is to predict the index of the value in the array.
